# Getting Started

## Setting up Yarn

> Note: If you don’t have Yarn >=1.22.10 installed on your computer, update it with the same install command.

```
npm install -g yarn
```

A .yarn directory and .yarnrc.yml file will both be created that need to be checked into git. These are the files that will set up your project’s local Yarn instance.
