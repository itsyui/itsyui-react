* State Management library, it is simple and scalable.
* Opinionated framework of sorts.
* Set of rich UI components specifically designed for metadata driven UI.

## Future-Proof Architecture

ItsyUI has generally 3 high-level layers,

1. Shell Widgets - Written in pure ReactJS + Finite State Machines (FSM with xstate), and defines the behavior of a widget.
2. UI Widgets - The UI layer forms the way a widget is rendered on screen and only deals with UI and Styling of the widget.
3. Framework Bindings - Configuration based bindings that allow to define UI flows and its behavior as simple JSON configuration. This allows for reusable configurations, for ex: Invoking a REST API on FORM SUBMIT event.
